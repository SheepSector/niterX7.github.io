            <p>Hello. My name is Jay Edwards. I'm a Computational Media major at the Georgia Institute of Technology. </p> 

            <p>NITER7 is not a company or brand, but rather a sort of emblem; a title for the organization of the work that I love to do. I present some of it here on this site.</p>

            <h2>Me and my children.</h2> 

 
 

            <p>      

                Niter is merely an old abbreviation for potassium nitrate; a component of gunpowder in the civil war and now an ingredient in various industrial processes.  

                Neither of these things relate to this name I have chosen. I chose it because to me, only within its sound, it bears potency, sharpness, and overtness.  

                These are words I would not crudely use to characterize myself, but rather descriptions of a general philosophy that can define my ambition, spirit,  

                and vision for the future. 

            </p> 

            <p> 

                I am a hard worker when I value my work. I will deliver either fiercely, or not at all. I strive for excellence and I want to create an impact that can motivate and change those around me.  

            </p> 

            <p> 

                What none of this includes however is my value of art. I find that with my ideas, in their birth or execution, I rely more upon my nature as a human,  

                an individual - alongside the like-minds of those around me - rather than an adherence to non-basic science and mathematics, or really any existing  

                foundation that would otherwise define procedure.  

                I will not immediately clarify that that being said, I value rules and regulations and never intend to break them. I do not. I respect rules and regulations and  

                above anything else when they are to ensure  

                the safety, security, and comfort of my teammates, peers, and the interests of those I work for. I take on the world with an artistic and rebellious  

                nature where I can, but I recognize the  

                great importance of keeping my people safe, abiding by authority, and respecting that which is in place for a reason.  

            </p> 

            <p> 

                All of that being said, I chose to succeed the term with the number 7. NITER7. Sparing originality, much like art, the number is strange; one digit, 

                prime, odd. It does not have the triangularity of 3, or the base-10 compatibility of 5.  

                 

                From some perspectives, it can even  signify a great appetite for knowledge, truth, and understanding for the mysteries of  

                life. So, to me, it describes what I wholly strive to be for myself and the those around me.  

            </p> 

            <p> 

                I work hard, I think hard. I seek my dreams, I seek truth. I love artistic thinking and use it where I can, but I acknowledge there are many places  

                where it is not warranted.  

                I'm independent, but I play for my superiors and I play for my peers. I know the greatest creations will only come from collaboration, and that  

                there is no greater experience than working with a good team.
